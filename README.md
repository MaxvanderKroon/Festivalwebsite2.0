Hello stranger!

Welcome to our new project! We are creating a website with HTML, CSS, JS and C#. Our goal is to create a website on which you can find all kinds of different festivals
and read about them (as well as book tickets to them!). This is our first time creating such a webstite, and we are still learning and figuring out how to add all kinds of
neat features to make the website look amazing!
